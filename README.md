I am a software engineer with over 3 years of combined full-time and internship experience in developing and maintaining software solutions, mostly built with Javascript, Kotlin, and Golang. I have helped companies optimize and enhance the reliability of their software products.

Some examples of my work include:

- Currently, as a software engineer at Spinny, I am working with the Inspection team to optimize and enhance the reliability of the Inspection app, along with implementing new features that come from product. My work has led to improved performance of the app on slow and old devices, and a crash-free user experience.

- As a full-stack engineer at Trademarkia, I led a team of four in building a community-centric social media platform with a focus on performance and a bug-free experience for the end-user. One of the most highly optimized and reliable features of the platform is a video recording component that is supported on all major web-based browsers such as Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.

- As a software engineering intern at Vidrona, I worked closely with designers to develop new designs and software products like vLineman with lag-free performance and a crash-free experience.

I am excited about new opportunities where I can work on developing new features and improving the performance and reliability of existing features, which in turn provide a better experience for end-users.

I love connecting with new people, and you can reach me at sarthakpranesh08@gmail.com
